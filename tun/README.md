The project requires some dependencies.
One of the dependencies is Boost, and to install it on Debian/Ubuntu run (X.YZ >= 1.49):
    sudo apt-get install libboostX.YZ-dev

To configure waf and download additional dependencies from GitHub:
    ./waf configure --bundle=ALL --bundle-path=../dependencies/ --options=cxx_debug

To build all executables:
    ./waf

To run the test (requires a tun0 interface, see below), run the executable in:
    ./build/test
Some tests are known to fail on low performance setups.

For the coded tunnels (requires a tun interface, see below) run the executables in either (depending on the setup):
    ./build/apps/singlepath
    ./build/apps/multipath
The coded tunnel executables require a various command line parameters, and by running the executable without parameters shows the order in which they must be provided.

Create a TUN interface, in this case we create tun0 with ip 10.0.0.1:
    ./scripts/tun_setup.sh tun0 10.0.0.1
Running this script will require the user password to obtain sudo privileges.

The results described in "Single-hop â€“ WLAN setup" can be recreated using these scripts:
    ./report_delay_0.sh
    ./report_delay_10.sh
    ./report_delay_50.sh
The scripts has to be run from within the ./scripts folder.
The scripts require some modification of a few variables.
These are can be found on lines 4 through 16 within each script along with a description.
